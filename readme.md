*Bits & Pieces*  

**Description**:  
A minimalist digital journal where each day is a tiny fragment of time, waiting to be filled. Click on any day to leave your markâ€”add a note, a thought, or a memory. These moments live quietly in the grid, highlighted as soft, glowing reminders of the stories youâ€™ve chosen to save. Your entries linger, always there when you return, forming a mosaic of your year, one day at a time. âœ¨
